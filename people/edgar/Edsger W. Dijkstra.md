# Edsger Dijkstra

## Bio

> Edsger W. Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist known for his fundamental contributions to the field of computer science, particularly in algorithm design and formal methods. He is widely recognized for his role in the development of programming languages and software engineering principles.

## Quotes

> "Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better." [1]

> "The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim." [1]
