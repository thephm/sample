# Alonzo Church

## Bio

> Alonzo Church was an American mathematician and logician who made significant contributions to the fields of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. He is best known for his development of the lambda calculus and for the Church-Turing thesis.

## Quotes

> "It is essential to understand that madness is not, in general, related to eccentricity. It is fundamentally a disorder of thought, a form of disease of the mind. It has nothing to do with being 'strange' or 'different.'” [1]

> "The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [1]

## Notes

- Church's work laid the foundation for modern theoretical computer science, particularly in the areas of computability theory and the theory of algorithms.
- His Church-Turing thesis, formulated in the 1930s, is one of the central concepts in computer science, stating that any function that can be computed by an algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine.
