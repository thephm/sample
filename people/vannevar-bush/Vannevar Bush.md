# Vannevar Bush

## Bio

> Vannevar Bush was an American engineer, inventor, and science administrator, best known for his work as an advocate for scientific research and development. Born on March 11, 1890, Bush played a pivotal role in the development of early computing and information systems.

## Quotes

> "There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workersâ€”conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial."
