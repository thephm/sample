# Richard Stallman

## Bio

> Richard Stallman, often referred to by his initials RMS, is an American free software movement activist and computer programmer. He is best known as the founder of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project.

## Quotes

> "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'"
> "I could have made money this way, and perhaps amused myself writing code. But I knew that at the end of my career, I would look back on years of building walls to divide people, and feel I had spent my life making the world a worse place."
> "Sharing is good, and with digital technology, sharing is easy."
