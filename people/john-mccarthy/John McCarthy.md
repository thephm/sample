# John McCarthy

## Bio

> John McCarthy was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist known for his pioneering work in artificial intelligence. He is widely recognized for coining the term "artificial intelligence" and for developing the Lisp programming language.

## Quotes

> "Artificial intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines." [1]

> "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." [1]
