# Alan Turing

## Bio

> Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalization of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Quotes

> "Machines take me by surprise with great frequency."

> "Sometimes it is the people no one can imagine anything of who do the things no one can imagine."
