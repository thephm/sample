# Ada Lovelace

## Bio

> Ada Lovelace, born Augusta Ada Byron, was an English mathematician and writer. She is known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine, making her the world's first computer programmer.

## Quotes

> "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform." [1]

> "That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal, as time will show." [2]

> "I am more than ever now the bride of science." [3]
