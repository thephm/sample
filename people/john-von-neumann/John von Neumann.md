# John von Neumann

## Bio

> John von Neumann was a Hungarian-American mathematician, physicist, and computer scientist who made significant contributions to a wide range of fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science.

## Quotes

> "If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is." [1]

> "The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work." [1]
