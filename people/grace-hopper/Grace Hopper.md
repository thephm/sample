## Quotes

> "The most dangerous phrase in the language is, 'We've always done it this way.'" [1]

> "Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise." [2]

> "A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for." [3]
