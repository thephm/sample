# Tim Berners-Lee

## Bio

> Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee is an English engineer and computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989 and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in 1990.

## Quotes

> "The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past." [1]

> "Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch." [2]

> "The Web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect—to help people work together—and not as a technical toy." [3]
